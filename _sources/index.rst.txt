Overview
========

Cetmodules is, at its core, a wrapper around low-level CMake functionality
intended to fulfill the following goals:

#. Reduce the number of CMake commands necessary to accomplish common
   tasks, including for "modern" (v3+) CMake functionality such as
   `pseudo-targets <https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-buildsystem.7.html#pseudo-targets>`_.
#. Generate CMake config files automatically, taking care of the
   bookkeeping necessary to handle transitive dependencies with minimum
   user intervention.
#. Provide domain-specific build tools useful to scientists utilizing
   the "Art"\ :abbr:`HEP (High Energy Physics)` analysis framwork to
   process data from (mainly) neutrino experiments.

Target user base
----------------

Cetmodules was developed as a backward-compatible replacement for an
earlier tool satisfying the latter goal above called "cetbuildtools,"
which was intimately tied to a `domain-specific package management
system
<https://cdcvs.fnal.gov/redmine/projects/ups/wiki/Documentation>`_
called |UPS|. Notwithstanding its origins, Cetmodules is intended to be
a general build toolâ€”although someone from outside the original target
community might encounter some puzzling terminology, vestigial
functionality, or other endearing quirks.
